    # Basic chat formats.
    # The "default_format" format is the main one you want to edit.
    # The "console" format is what's shown to console.
    # The "discord" format is what's shown to supported discord integrations.
    # If PlaceholderAPI is installed, PAPI placeholders (with %) are supported.
    # If MiniPlaceholders is installed, its placeholders (with <>) are supported.
    # The keys are group names, the values are chat formats (MiniMessage).
    # For example:
    #     basic {
    #         default_format="<<username>> <message>"
    #         vip="[VIP] <<username>> <message>"
    #         admin="<white>[</white>Prefix<white>]</white> <display_name><white>: <message></white>"
    #         discord="<message>"
